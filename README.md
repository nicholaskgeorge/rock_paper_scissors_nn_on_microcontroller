# Rock–Paper–Scissors Neural Network on Microcontroller

## Project Context  
This repository contains the implementation of a lightweight neural network for recognizing hand gestures—rock, paper, and scissors—deployed on a microcontroller. The work was completed as part of the course **ENMGT 5400 Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence**. By the end of the term project presentations, no team achieved more than 2/3 accuracy on real-time inference.

> **Note:** Focus on the `RPS/` folder for the complete RPS pipeline. Other directories are for testing and experimentation.

## Key Details  
- **Course:** ENMGT 5400 Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence  
- **Dataset:** Custom-collected hand-gesture images  
- **Model:** TensorFlow/Keras → TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers  
- **Deployment:** Microcontroller-based real-time inference  
- **Outcome:** Maximum on-device accuracy reached ~66.7%; no group surpassed 2/3 accuracy under course conditions.
